## The Question

This file illustrates the fact that you could get smaller p-value by increasing sample size.

## The Setup
Two groups of numbers were drawn from $N(0, 1)$ and $N(0.1, 1)$. T-test was then used for the following hypothesis testing.

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$$
$$H_1: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$$

We repeated the test 100 times under each sample size.

```{r}
for (sample.size in c(10, 100, 1000, 1e4)) {
  p.val <- numeric()
  for (i in 1:100) {
    n1 <- n2 <- sample.size
    
    x <- c(rnorm(n1, mean = 0), rnorm(n2, mean = 0.1))
    y <- c(rep(0, n1), rep(1, n2))
    
    tmp <- t.test(x~y)
    p.val <- c(p.val, tmp$p.value)
  }
  print(sprintf('sample size: %d, p-value: %.4f.', sample.size, mean(p.val)))
}
```

With the same underlying distribution, the p-value decreased as we increased the sample size.
